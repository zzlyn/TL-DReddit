reads comments from a reddit post, use external api to analyze its contents



2017-08-06



Using a recursive method, now I can retrieve all comments on a reddit post regardless of how deep/long the comment tree is.



Now I have to figure out what external api to use to process these comment data, google seems like the first choice here but we will see.



This readme.md is my dev log for now, update it to a description of the project (which it should be) later.
